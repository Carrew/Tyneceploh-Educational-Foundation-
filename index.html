    <!-- History -->
    <section>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Tyneceploh Educational Foundation is a lifelong dream that has been realized in the absence of the dreamer, the late Margret Ploh Chattah. The special passion for child development which Mrs. Margret Ploh Chattah believed was a gift from God started to be actualized with a groundbreaking program on January 25, 2015. The construction of the building began in April 2015 unfortunately she got sick and was taken to India in June for treatment but never returned. This dream championed by her widower Mr. Napoleon T. Chattah along with other well-wishers germinated on September 3, 2018. Today, TEF is proud in fulfilling this dream while contributing to our country Liberia as indicated in Article 6 of our Constitution: providing equal access to educational opportunities and facilities for all citizens to the extent of available resources.</p>

      While we endeavor to seek academic excellence, we subscribe to the Ministry of Education Minimum passing grade of 70%. However we encourage students to strive for higher marks by regularly recognizing and rewarding gifts or promotion.
      Students who maintain 95% average from first period through the first semester will be promoted to the next class except where the student is in the highest class of the school.
      Students failing in one subject in the average for the year will be promoted under condition and is compelled to attend the enrichment classes but will still have to be monitored during the first period in the new class.
      Students failing in two (2) or more subjects repeat the class.
