    <h2>School Ode</h2>
    <pre>
We meet here from all walks of life
From different homes and families
We hope to be as one
Foundation that so strong
To keep us safe from strife
We cross the Rubicon
By trusting God alone

Chorus

Tyneceploh we love you
Tyneceploh prepare our hearts for life here
And life to come
We are not the same
On our way to face the world
You've shown the way, you made us proud
You've built us for good future

(Chorus 2x)

  <section class="section history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Tyneceploh Educational Foundation is a lifelong dream that has been realized in the absence of the dreamer, the late Margret Ploh Chattah. The special passion for child development which Mrs. Margret Ploh Chattah believed was a gift from God started to be actualized with a groundbreaking program on January 25, 2015. The construction of the building began in April 2015. Unfortunately, she got sick and was taken to India in June for treatment but never returned. This dream, championed by her widower Mr. Napoleon T. Chattah along with other well-wishers, germinated on September 3, 2018. Today, TEF is proud in fulfilling this dream while contributing to our country Liberia as indicated in Article 6 of our Constitution: providing equal access to educational opportunities and facilities for all citizens to the extent of available resources.
